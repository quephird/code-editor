ICE Code Editor
===============

This is just a simple tweak of the very cool ICE Code Editor by eee-c, 
https://github.com/eee-c, which is used by the equally cool book,
[3D Game Programming for Kids](http://gamingjs.com).

This version allows for offline editing; the only changes I made were to reference local versions
of JavaScript dependencies and to the four code templates which also had references to those libraries.
This also means that those libraries are bundled with the code as well, obviously.
